This project provides a Minecraft: Java Edition resource pack for mapping newer Chinese translations back to older versions.

## Download

- [**Download the latest version**](https://github.com/SkyEye-FAST/renovation_translation_pack/releases/latest/)
- [View previous versions](https://github.com/SkyEye-FAST/renovation_translation_pack/releases/)

## Languages

The resource pack currently supports 4 languages: `zh_cn`, `zh_tw`, `zh_hk`, and `lzh`.

> [!NOTE]
> `zh_cn` and `zh_tw` were referred to as `zh_CN` and `zh_TW` before 1.11.x.
>
> `zh_hk` and `lzh` are available in version 1.15.x and above.

## Version Compatibility

**The resource pack is compatible with all versions from 1.7.10 to 1.19.2.**

The version marked in the resource pack releases applies to an entire major version, such as a resource pack marked as `1.16.5` applies to versions from 1.16 to 1.16.5.

> [!TIP]
> All versions of language files after 1.19.2 (1.19.3 and beyond) are being continuously updated, **so it is *unnecessary* to use the resource pack in those versions.**
